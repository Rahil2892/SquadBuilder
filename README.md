# Squad Builder
Squad Builder, a project by two football enthusiasts, we have used HTML, CSS, PHP and Javascript for development, it’s a simple football insight web app where users can simulate the experience of fantasy football squad building. It has three main features namely:
Fixtures
Player info
Squad Builder
To navigate to these features we have designed a basic home page which can be used by anyone without instructions. Just with one click users can visit the different tabs.

**1.Fixtures:**
	One can see all the upcoming matches with the date and time of the matches.

[SS]

**2.Player Info:**
	Here, the information of all the players is displayed with all the necessary stats like goals, assists,  cleansheets, etc.

**3.Squad Builder:**
	The main purpose of the web app, every user can build their own fantasy team by choosing the formation & players of their choice.

When you click on the Squad builder tab from the homepage you will be redirected to the page where you can choose the formation, the instructions of the team are displayed here itself. Also if the person has any queries they can submit it.

After the user chooses desired formation they will have to register themself and if they are already registered they will just have to sign in.

 After signing In, the option to select the team will be displayed and the user will have to choose the team of his choice according to the formation they chose.

If for some reason the user wants to change the formation then they can do so by clicking the button provided for it at the very bottom and then the user will be redirected back to the page where they can select the formation again.

[SS]


And if the user has selected the team of their choice then can submit the team by pressing the submit button. User’s team would later be displayed on the same page.
