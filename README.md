# Squad Builder
Squad Builder, a project by two football enthusiasts, we have used HTML, CSS, PHP and Javascript for development, it’s a simple football insight web app where users can simulate the experience of fantasy football squad building. It has three main features namely:
Fixtures
Player info
Squad Builder
To navigate to these features we have designed a basic home page which can be used by anyone without instructions. Just with one click users can visit the different tabs.

*HomePage:*

When you click on the Squad builder tab from the homepage you will be redirected to the page where you can choose the formation, the instructions of the team are displayed here itself. Also if the person has any queries they can submit it.

After the user chooses desired formation they will have to register themself and if they are already registered they will just have to sign in.
